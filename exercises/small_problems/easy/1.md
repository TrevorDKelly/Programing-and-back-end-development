  The `repeat` method is defined from line one to line 6 and takes two paramiters, `str` and `times`.
  On **lines 2 through 5** a while loop **is invoked**. It is passed the argument `times > 0` and will continually run **the loop** as for long as the argument evaluates to true.
  During each iteration of the loop lines 3 and 4 will run.
  On line 3, the `puts` method is invoked and it is passed the local variable `str` as an argument. this will output the value that is passed into the method at invocation and it will return `nil`.
  On line 4, the `-=` assignment operator reassigns local variable `times` to the value currently assigned to it minus one.
  When `times > 0` no longer evaluates to true, the while loop returns `nil`. since this is the last evaluated code in the method, the method will always have a return value of `nil`.

  ```ruby
  [[8, 13, 27], ['apple', 'banana', 'cantaloupe']].map do |arr|
    arr.select do |item|
      if item.to_s.to_i == item    # if it's an integer
        item > 13
      else
        item.size < 6
      end
    end
  end
```
  On line one the `map` method is invoked on a multidimentional array and is passed a block, that is on lines 1 to 9, as an argument. Each object referenced in the outer array is passed into the block in turn and assigned to the local variable `arr`.
  Within the block, on line 2 the `select` method is invoked on the local variable `arr` and is passed a block, that is on lines 2 through 8, as an argument. Each object referenced in `arr` is passed into the block in turn and assigned to the local variable `item`
  on line 3 the conditional `if` is passed the argument `item.to_s.to_i == item`. The `to_s` and `to_i` methods return the calling object as String objects and Integer objects respectively. If `item` references an Integer object `to_s.to_i` will return the same integer and `item.to_s.to_i == item` will return true. 
  if the argument passed to the `if` evaluates to true then line 4 is run, if the argument evaluates to false, line 6 is run. Line 4 only will run if `item` references an integer object and it evaluates
