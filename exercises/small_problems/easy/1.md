  The `repeat` method is defined from line one to line 6 and takes two paramiters, `str` and `times`.
  On **lines 2 through 5** a while loop **is invoked**. It is passed the argument `times > 0` and will continually run **the loop** as for long as the argument evaluates to true.
  During each iteration of the loop lines 3 and 4 will run.
  On line 3, the `puts` method is invoked and it is passed the local variable `str` as an argument. this will output the value that is passed into the method at invocation and it will return `nil`.
  On line 4, the `-=` assignment operator reassigns local variable `times` to the value currently assigned to it minus one.
  When `times > 0` no longer evaluates to true, the while loop returns `nil`. since this is the last evaluated code in the method, the method will always have a return value of `nil`.

```ruby
  def is_odd?(num)
    num % 2 == 1
  end
```

the `is_odd?` method is defined on lines 1 through 3 and has one paramiter, the method local variable `num`. on line two `num` calls the `%` method and passes the integer `2` as an argument. `%` returns the remainder of the calling object divided by the argument. the equivalance oporator then checks if `num % 2` is equal to `1` and retuns a boolean. since this is the last line of code run in the method, its return value is what the method returns.

```ruby
  def digit_list(num)
    list = []
    num.to_s.each_char do |n|
      list << n.to_i
    end
    list
  end
```

The `digit_list` method is defined on lines 1 through 7 and has one paramiter, the method local variable `num`.
on line two the local variable `list` is initialized and assigned an empty array object. 
on line 3 `num` calls the `to_s` method which returns a string object. `each_char` is caled on that string and is passed a `do..end` block with one paramiter, the block local variable `n`. each character in the string returned by the `to_s` method is assinged to `n` and the block is run.
on line 4 the local variable `list` calls the `<<` method with `n.to_i` as an argument. this mutates `list` by appending the integer returned by `n.to_i`. `<<` returns the mutated object assigned to `list`. the block also returns the object assigned to `list` but `each_char` does nothing with that value and returns the calling object, `num.to_s`.
line six evaluates the local variable `list` so that it is the last line evaluated by the method and the object assigned to it is returned by the method.
