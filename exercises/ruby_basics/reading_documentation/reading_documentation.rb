# Where to find Documentation
  # There are a lot of places to find documentation. The one i prefer is docs.ruby-lang.org.
  # It is very similar to ruby-docs.org with just a few minor differences.
  
# Locating the while loop
  # The While loop is within the documentation for conditional expressions along with 'if' 'case' 'for' and 'until'
  
# Return of a while loop
  # a while loop will return nil unless it is ended with a break. 
  # per the break documentation, whatever values breaks the loop will be retuned.
  
# retun value from break in a while loop
  # break will retun the value of the argument causing the break
  # if no argument is given the return will be nil
  
# Large Numbers
  # readablility for large numbers can be increased by using underscores in the number
  # in documentation : syntax --> literals --> numbers
  
# Symbol Syntax
  :trevor
  # a colon before the text creates a symbol. or in a hash a colon after and the value can follow it
  
# String Class
  # the sting Class can be found in the Classes and Modules list or by searching for "string"
  
# Right Justify Strings
  # the #rjust method can be called on a sting to righ justify it
  # it gets passed one argumentwhich moves the last letter to that index of the string
