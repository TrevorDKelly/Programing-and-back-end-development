  Problem
    Make a calculator
    inputs two numbers separated by an operator ( + - / * )
    outputs result
    inputs all entered by user
    Questions
      only whole numbers? Negatives?
      ask more than once?
      follow up on results?
      order of input? number number operator? number operator number?
      maximum number?
    mental model
      get three inputs from a user, two numbers & an operator. calculate result
      of the created equation
      
  Examples
    input = 5 * 5
    output = 25
    
    input = 10 / 0
    output = cant devide by 0
    
    input = 10 - 20
    output = -10
    
    input = 1000000 * 10000000
    output = 10000000000000
    
  Data Structure
    integers for numbers
    convert 'operator' to operator  -- #public_send()
    
  Algorithm
    create a number check method
    ask user for first number
      check for corect input
      assign to num1 float variable
    ask for operator
      check for correct input
    ask user for second number
      check for correct input
      assign to num2 float variable
    
    return num 1 (operator changed from string to operator) num2
