Methods **********************************


Vocab ************************************
	
	-Boolean
		Only purpose is to convey a true or false value

	-Conditional Operators
		Comparison Operators -- &&  ,  | |
		Short Circuiting
			Comparison operators return their value (true or false) one they are certain of it
				Ex.   if  true || ERROR => true  -- the error is never reached
		Everything is true except false and nil
	
	-Procedural Way / Imperitive Way
		Step by step logic a program needs to follow, the flow written out
	Declaritive Way
		using methods to abstract away some of the flow of logic
	EX. using the each method vs making a flow chart that details each loop
	
	-yaml
		configuration file type
		To Use
			at top put
				require 'yaml'
			to parse in a file put
				VARIABLE_NAME = YAML.load_file('example_file.yml')
			

	
Psudo Code *******************************
	
	START            Start the program
	SET              Set a variable
	GET              Get input from user
	PRINT            display output to user
	READ             retreive value from variable
	IF/ELSE IF/ELSE  show conditional branches
	WHILE            show looping logic
	SUBPROCESS			 infers other sudocode has handled the logic
	END              end program
	
	
	
	
RuboCop **********************************
  https://launchschool.com/lessons/a0f3cd44/assignments/8e770c8a
	
	analizes code for mistakes in convention or coding errors
	
	TO RUN
		in comand line => rubocop file_name.rb
		
	The Return
		example => hello.rb:1:13:C: message containg the error
		  means => file : row : column : error code : message
		
		Codes 
			C => convention => styling of code
			W => warning
			E => error
			F => fatal error
			
	To Configure
		
		It will look for a .rubocop.yml file in the current directory 
			then recusively through the parent directories
		Try not to nest these files
		
		
		
Pry ******************************

	Debugging tool that allows you to stop a program and check the valuses of all
	variables at that point. 
	
	To Use
		at start of program put 
			require 'pry'
		at the stop point you want put
			binding.pry
		to exit type
			exit-program
